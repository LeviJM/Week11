About:
This is my Week 11 FE Course Project. The assignment is to make a Tic Tac Toe Game!!

2/26/2023:
Fixed the border on the grid so it looked better.
Made it so once you use a square it becomes disabled and you can't use it again
Added a function that checks all win conditions and if someone wins it disables
the game and makes the text at the top display which player won.
So far its a fully functioning Tic Tac Toe game!



2/25/2023:
Created a 3x3 grid with buttons in each.
When you click a button the color changes depending on which players turn it is.

3/1/2023:
Added a working refresh button to the grid.

3/4/2023:
Added a tie function
Added bootstrap alerts for P1 win P2 win or Tie
